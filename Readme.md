App get data from Git ant trying to show it )
Based on Expo

Use:
 - react-native-size-matters - for scaling sizes
 - Redux
 - Expo-secure-store as local storage

Problems:
- I'm not sure, that 'debounce' is correct (
- Limited size of Data from Git (one page)
- simple JS
- History not clickable ) (can fix if needed)
